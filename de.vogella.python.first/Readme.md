## Synopsis
de.vogella.python.first is an example package from [this online tutorial](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Python/article.html "Tutorial")
by Lars Vogel. 
It contains one module, "FirstModule.py", comprising two classes "chicken" and
"addFixedValue". This serves as a simple example that I am using to learn about
LiClipse, Git, GitHub etc.
The project does not do anything useful.
